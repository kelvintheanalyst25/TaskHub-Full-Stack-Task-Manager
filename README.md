# TaskHub – Full-Stack Task Manager

**TaskHub** is a full-stack task management application built using **React** (frontend), **Node.js + Express** (backend), and mock in-memory storage (JSON). It allows users to add, view, and manage their daily tasks.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code

Let me know if you'd like a version using Django instead of Node.js, or more advanced features like user authentication or database storage. ​:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}​
